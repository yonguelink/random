This is my first thread, so be kind please...

I almost gave up on the trial of the sword, but a kind man on here gave me a few tricks and I got it. So I thought, why not sharing the tricks I received and those I used to everyone?

This thread is intended to be ever evolving until everyone can clear the trials, so if you have more tricks to add, or specific techniques to beat a room, share them in the comment and I'll add them here!
It's also aimed at the Master Mode version of things, so I'll be listing monster as their version in Master Mode.
If I made any errors, let me know!

tl;dr: If you have trouble with the trials, read the post.

Here I go:

# General tips

* Cook an extra def boost for 30 minute, that will help you clear at least (if not more) half of the trial, making small mistakes such as a Boko punch or spear attack be much less annoying (1/4 to 1 heart dmg, instead of 3-4 to 10-12). 
	* Cooking a x3 boost for 30 minute requires x4 of def/atk boosting ingrediant and a dragon horn. [More info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/64xxw2/botw_guide_ultimate_cooking_all_boost_recipes/)
* Stasis REALLY helps, and even more vs hinox, Stasis them while their eye isn't covered and fire an arrow at it. It'll stun it even if it's still in stasis.
* Water in the room? Drop the any non swimming enemies into it!
* Any enemy that you feel have too powerful/annoying weapon, shock them, they drop their weapon (pick them up in the process) and will be way less dangerous.

# Beginners trial

|Room|Monsters|Tip|   
|----|--------|---|
|1|3x Blue Bokos|Crouch, get as close as possible from behind, then run like crazy to pick up most, if not all gear|
|2|1x Fire Chuchu & 4x Blue Bokos|Throw just about anything at the chuchu to kill it. Kill the archer on the tower. Slow-mo from threes|
|3|9x Chuchus (in rounds)||
|4|x5 Blue Bokos & x2 Dark Bokos||
|5|x2 Blue Moblin & x3 Black Bokos||
|6|x1 Talus||
|7|Rest|Carefully pick up the fairy, and everything else in the room. Cook everything. Avoid eating any buff-giving meals, you can even mix two buff giving items to cancel it out|
|8|x1 Electric Chuchu & x2 Blue Lizalfos & x2 Black Lizalfos|If a Lizalfos gets in water, get back as far as possible so he needs to get out to hit you|
|9|x2 Octorok & x1 Thunder Wizzrobe|Avoid letting the wizzrobe dance. I found fire arrow quite good on him, as he tries to put it off for a while|
|10|x1 Blue lizalfos & x2 White Lizalfos|Stasis the archer ASAP. Kill him while he's under stasis effect. Kill the white Lizalfos room by either sneakstrike chaining or [burning them to death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-F4ZlpeKBY)|
|11|x4 Blue Bokos & x3 Black Bokos & x1 White Boko & x1 White Moblin|Drop everything you can in the water|
|12|x1 Black Hinox|Stasis, Arrow+Eye = win|

# Middle trial

Don't be afraid to use arrows, you have plenty (That was my biggest mistake). 

|Room|Monsters|Tip|   
|----|--------|---|
|1|x5 Blue Bokos|Use the archer with fire arrow to burn leaves and let you pick up good weapons before starting the fight|
|2|x2 Blue Bokos & x1 Black Boko & x2 Meteo Wizzrobe|Glide ASAP. Headshot Wizzrobes so they vanish|
|3|x4 blue Bokos & x3 Black Bokos|This one is annoying with the bomb arrows, move carefully. I wish I could give more of a tip here...|
|4|x1 Decayed Guardian|I shield parried it, but was lucky with no delayed shots...|
|5|Rest|Carefully pickup fairies, cook.|
|6|x5 Fire Keeses & x1 Electric Chuchu|Until the next resting spot, it'll be dark.|
|7|x2 Fire Lizalfos & x3 Blue Lizalfos|Ice works wonder on Fire stuff|
|8|x1 Meteo Wizzrobe & x3 White(?) Bokos|Ice arrow the Wizzrobe, or stun him while killing him! He must NOT cast his meteors, thread carefully with the Bokos|
|9|x1 Decayed guardian|See prior Guardian|
|10|x1 Black Hinox|See prior Hinox, except its dark|
|11|Rest|See prior rest area|
|12|x6 Guardian Scouts I|Ice pillar, slow-mo headshot. The pillars also blocks their shots|
|13|x3 Guardian Scouts II|Use both rods you get to stun them, and flurry rush them! (Good luck, it's annoying) Focus on one at the time, so it can't regen. There's also a large metal block hidden in the room, you may (or not) drop it from very high on the Scouts|
|14|x4 Guardian Scouts I & x2 Guardian Scout II|Ice Pillar + slow-mo for the Scout I. Once all 4 are dead, move to where one was, and stasis one Scout II, fire two arrows at it, un-stasis it, it'll move close to the water, stasis ASAP again, and fire to more arrows. Move onto the next.|
|15|x2 Guardian Scout III|Use the leaves on the ground to burn them. Focus on one at the time|
|16|x1 Guardian Scout IV|Regular Major Test of Strength, flurry rush!|

# Final trial

* Lava? Drop the enemies into it!
* Scary enemy? Shock!
* Scary enemy? Freeze! (x3 dmg on frozen enemy!)
* Archer? Slow-mo!
* There are 3 chests with 3 ancient arrow each in the trial, one in the first resting area, one in the lava area (in the lava) and one in the cold area (under a block of ice iirc)
* Kill the first lynel without Ancient arrow, you're gonna want his bow for the guardian rooms
* There's a mighty lynel crusher in the first Lynel room (as well as a spear, and the sword the Lynel carries)
* Flying guardians can be one shotted with ancient arrow if you hit them on the back. Get a vintage point and fire away!
* Decayed guardians can be easily killed one by one with the Lynel Crusher (spin to win, avoid smashing the crusher on the ground)
* If a decayed guardian wakes up before you can get close to him, hide behind trees, and stasis him while approaching. Once stasis finishes, fire an arrow to stun him, spin to win.
* Guardians protects you from other guardians
* In the final room, 8 Bokos will come charging on horses, hiding a golden lynel firing ? arrows at you. Take the Lynel out with an Ancient arrow ASAP. Then ignore the Bokos, and get to the sentry on top of the tower, Ancient arrow with lynel bow will kill it, then slow-mo each Boko, one by one, headshot with pretty much any bow will one shot them.


* Final point: [keep in mind the multiplier you can find in this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiaqiORIK0BVTRjO-PtHKyAL5nTT8QushYDIWozNwoo/edit)
