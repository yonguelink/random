This is my first thread, so be kind please...


I forgot to mention it in the title: **This is intended to be for Master Mode** Obviously the tips are still valid for normal mode thought 


I almost gave up on the trial of the sword, but a kind man on here gave me a few tricks and I got it. So I thought, why not sharing the tricks I received and those I used to everyone?

This thread is intended to be ever evolving until everyone can clear the trials, so if you have more tricks to add, or specific techniques to beat a room, share them in the comment and I'll add them here!
It's also aimed at the Master Mode version of things, so I'll be listing monster as their version in Master Mode.
If I made any errors, let me know!

tl;dr: If you have trouble with the trials, read the post.

Here I go:

# General tips

* Cook an extra def boost for 30 minute, that will help you clear at least (if not more) half of the trial, making small mistakes such as a Boko punch or spear attack be much less annoying (1/4 to 1 heart dmg, instead of 3-4 to 10-12). 
	* Cooking a x3 boost for 30 minute requires x4 of def/atk boosting ingredient and a dragon horn. [More info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/64xxw2/botw_guide_ultimate_cooking_all_boost_recipes/)
* Any buff can be taken before the trial, including extra stamina and extra hearts. Cook them Hearty and Enduring ingredients!
* Stasis REALLY helps, and even more vs hinox, Stasis them while their eye isn't covered and fire an arrow at it. It'll stun it even if it's still in stasis.
* Water in the room? Drop the any non swimming enemies into it!
* Any enemy that you feel have too powerful/annoying weapon, shock them, they drop their weapon (pick them up in the process) and will be way less dangerous.
* [Keep in mind the multiplier you can find in this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiaqiORIK0BVTRjO-PtHKyAL5nTT8QushYDIWozNwoo/edit)
* There are chests hidden here and there, set your Sheikah sensor to detect them.
* If you can find a safe spot in a stage and you want to be absolutely sure to preserve your weapons/health, there is no shame in just using Sheikah bombs. It'll take forever, but can be worth it.

# Beginners trial

|Room|Monsters|Tip|   
|----|--------|---|
|1|3x Blue Bokos|Crouch, get as close as possible from behind, then run like crazy to pick up most, if not all gear|
|2|1x Fire Chuchu & 4x Blue Bokos|Throw just about anything at the chuchu to kill it. Kill the archer on the tower. Slow-mo from threes|
|3|9x Chuchus (in rounds)||
|4|x5 Blue Bokos & x2 Dark Bokos||
|5|x2 Blue Moblin & x3 Black Bokos||
|6|x1 Talus||
|7|Rest|Carefully pick up the fairy, and everything else in the room. Cook everything. Avoid eating any buff-giving meals, you can even mix two buff giving items to cancel it out|
|8|x1 Electric Chuchu & x2 Blue Lizalfos & x2 Black Lizalfos|If a Lizalfos gets in water, get back as far as possible so he needs to get out to hit you|
|9|x2 Octorok & x1 Thunder Wizzrobe|Avoid letting the wizzrobe dance. I found fire arrow quite good on him, as he tries to put it off for a while|
|10|x1 Blue lizalfos & x2 White Lizalfos|Stasis the archer ASAP. Kill him while he's under stasis effect. Kill the white Lizalfos room by either sneak strike chaining or [burning them to death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-F4ZlpeKBY)|
|11|x4 Blue Bokos & x3 Black Bokos & x1 White Boko & x1 White Moblin|Drop everything you can in the water|
|12|x1 Black Hinox|Stasis, Arrow+Eye = win|

# Middle trial

Don't be afraid to use arrows, you have plenty (That was my biggest mistake). 

|Room|Monsters|Tip|   
|----|--------|---|
|1|x5 Blue Bokos|Use the archer with fire arrow to burn leaves and let you pick up good weapons before starting the fight|
|2|x2 Blue Bokos & x1 Black Boko & x2 Meteo Wizzrobe|Glide ASAP. Head shot Wizzrobes so they vanish|
|3|x4 blue Bokos & x3 Black Bokos|This one is annoying with the bomb arrows, move carefully. I wish I could give more of a tip here...|
|4|x1 Decayed Guardian|I shield parried it, but was lucky with no delayed shots...|
|5|Rest|Carefully pickup fairies, cook.|
|6|x5 Fire Keeses & x1 Electric Chuchu|Until the next resting spot, it'll be dark.|
|7|x2 Fire Lizalfos & x3 Blue Lizalfos|Ice works wonder on Fire stuff|
|8|x1 Meteo Wizzrobe & x3 White(?) Bokos|Ice arrow on the Wizzrobe, or stun him while killing him! He must NOT cast his meteors, thread carefully with the Bokos|
|9|x1 Decayed guardian|See prior Guardian|
|10|x1 Black Hinox|See prior Hinox, except its dark|
|11|Rest|See prior rest area|
|12|x6 Guardian Scouts I|Ice pillar, slow-mo head shot. The pillars also blocks their shots|
|13|x3 Guardian Scouts II|Use both rods you get to stun them, and flurry rush them! (Good luck, it's annoying) Focus on one at the time, so it can't regen. There's also a large metal block hidden in the room, you may (or not) drop it from very high on the Scouts|
|14|x4 Guardian Scouts I & x2 Guardian Scout II|Ice Pillar + slow-mo for the Scout I. Once all 4 are dead, move to where one was, and stasis one Scout II, fire two arrows at it, un-stasis it, it'll move close to the water, stasis ASAP again, and fire to more arrows. Move onto the next.|
|15|x2 Guardian Scout III|Use the leaves on the ground to burn them. Focus on one at the time|
|16|x1 Guardian Scout IV|Regular Major Test of Strength, flurry rush!|

# Final trial

Floor 1 to 5 is a dead forest with thunderstorms
Floor 7 to 11 is a lava area, very hot
Floor 13 to 17 is a cold area, fire weapons or food is required
Floor 19 to 23 is Castle Town style, calm sunny area with some buildings

|Room|Monsters|Tip|   
|----|--------|---|
|1|x4 Stal Bokos||
|2|x2 Electric Keese & x3 Stalizalfos||
|3|x2 Big Electric Chuchu & x5 Stalmoblin|The Moblin appears once you climb on the camp, arrow/bomb works just fine. Careful, there are hidden spikes in the vegetation|
|4|x7 Stal Bokos on Stalhorses|Bomb, there's one Boko with lightning arrows, be warry|
|5|x1 Stalnox|Stasis, grind his eye|
|6|Rest|Fairies! **x3 Ancient arrows**|
|7|x1 Big Fire Chuchu & x1 Rock Octorok & x2 Igneo Pebblit|Bombs|
|8|x3 Fire Lizalfos|Slow-mo head shots|
|9|x1 Meteo Wizzrobe & x1 Black Moblin & x2 Fire Lizalfos|Take out the Wizzrobe first, then try to take on one enemy at the time. Ice weapon one hit the Lizalfos.|
|10|x3 Black Moblin & x1 Fire Lizalfos|**x3 ANCIENT ARROW IN CHEST** Kill the Lizalfos first, then the archer Moblin, then aggro Moblin to the bottom one at the time. The chest is in lava|
|11|x1 Igneo Talus|Ice Arrow x1 + best 2h weapon, there are boulders you can break to get updraft|
|12|Rest|Fairies!|
|13|x2 Frost Pebblit & x1 Big Ice Chuchu & x2 Black Bokos & x1 Silver Boko||
|14|x2 Big Ice Chuchu & x1 Ice Lizalfos & x4 Black Bokos & x1 Gold Moblin|**x3 ANCIENT ARROW IN CHEST** Take out the Lizalfos and Bokos first, freeze the Moblin and hit him with your best weapon for x3 dmg, rinse and repeat. Chest is under frozen pillar.|
|15|x1 White Moblin & x1 Blizzrobe & x2 Black Bokos & x1 Golden Boko|Moblin > Blizzrobe > Black Bokos > Golden, same strat as previous floor|
|16|x1 Frost Talus|Fire arrow x1 + best 2h weapon, there are ice blocks you can melt to get updraft|
|17|x1 White Lynel|I strongly suggest killing him to get his bow. If you're confident you can "head shot" the remaining guardians, then you can kill it with an Ancient arrow. If you fight him: classic Lynel fight, if you can aim on his head, head shot him, climb on his back and repeat till it's dead. If you can't aim (like I couldn't), shield parry, flurry rush! The Lynel as a sword, you can find a spear and a crusher in the room.|
|18|Rest|Fairies! (No fairies? Hold the ones you have in your inventory, close your inventory, put them back and enjoy your extra fairies)|
|19|x6 Decayed Guardian|Either shield parry or spin to win with the crusher. Stealth till you are close to one and kill it. If one wakes up before you can reach it, hide behind trees and stasis him while you approach, head shot also stuns them for a good while|
|20|x1 Guardian Stalker|Either Ancient Arrow to the face or approach slowly, break his legs and finish the job with your best 1 handed (I broke 2 Royal Guard swords on it)|
|21|x1 Guardian Skywatcher|Ancient Arrow on his back, where the Sheikah logo is, or in his eye. If you have the Lynel's bow, the three arrow shot will kill it (500 dmg each, non crit)|
|22|x1 Guardian Skywatcher & x1 Guardian Stalker & x1 Guardian Turret|I went with the Skywatcher first, then the Stalker and the Turret at the end, always making sure I was in the Turret's blind spot. Ancient arrow FTW.|
|23|x8 Blue Bokos on horses & x1 Guardian Turret & x1 Golden Lynel|The Lynel is the real danger, Ancient Arrow ASAP. Ignore the Bokos charging full speed at you (while still trying to avoid their horses). Climb on the tower to kill the Turret, then head shot the Bokos one by one|

Congrats! You beat the trial! 

I finished with 2 ancient arrows left (and at least 3 full recovery food), I could've finished with 3 arrows, but missed the Lynel and hit a Boko's horse on the last floor... The Lynel bow really helped me, I ended up in a bad spot once, took out the bow and shot a Guardian at random, still killing it.


As this post will (probably) be updated often, I posted it on GitHub to keep track of it. You may find it [there](https://github.com/yonguelink/random/blob/master/tots.md). That version should always be the most up-to-date version.
